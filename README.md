## About This Repo

This repository is a **refactored collection** of all my **earliest projects and experiments** while learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **Bootstrap**.

It brings together everything from:

- Basic layout structure using HTML
- Styling with vanilla CSS
- My first responsive attempts with media queries
- Playing around with Bootstrap components
- ...and a bunch of bug-induced frustration turned into learning

## Why I Merged Multiple Repos?

When I first started learning, I created separate repos for every small concept or project (e.g. buttons, forms, flexbox).  
Now that I'm more experienced, I realized those scattered repos deserve to live together â€” in one well-organized archive that shows how I started.

This isn't just a repo, it's a **dev diary** from day one.
